ENKI Tattoo Card Audit Notes
Date: 2026-02-21

Scope
- src/app/**
- src/components/**
- src/lib/**

High-confidence findings
- Core app card language is consistent: rounded-xl + border-border + bg-surface-2 + shadow-soft.
- Grid behavior is centralized in globals via .grid-cards and .grid-cards-compact.
- Media ratio policy exists (.card-media) and is responsive (5/4 mobile, 4/3 md+).

Risks / inconsistencies
1) Gallery interactivity mismatch
- File: src/app/(app)/galeri/page.tsx
- Gallery cards are static article blocks (no hover/focus/link), while home/kesfet hub cards are interactive.

2) Duplication of hub card pattern
- Files: src/app/(app)/kesfet/page.tsx, src/app/(app)/page.tsx
- Same structural pattern is repeated with slight text/slot changes.

3) Shadow policy drift
- Files: src/components/ui/card.tsx, src/components/app/right-rail.tsx, src/app/(app)/iletisim/page.tsx
- Base Card uses shadow-sm, many app cards use shadow-soft; both coexist without explicit policy.

4) Truncation policy drift
- Files: src/app/(app)/galeri/page.tsx, src/app/(app)/kesfet/page.tsx, src/app/(app)/page.tsx
- Mostly truncate/line-clamp-1; no shared utility for title/subtitle clamp levels.

5) Legacy ratio divergence
- Files: src/components/legacy/social-mock/post-card.tsx, src/components/legacy/social-mock/feed-list.tsx
- legacy media uses aspect-video (16/9), unlike app card-media (5/4->4/3).

Recommended lock (V1)
- Interactive media cards:
  rounded-xl border border-border bg-surface-2 shadow-soft overflow-hidden transition-colors hover:bg-accent/50 focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-ring focus-visible:ring-offset-2
- Media slot:
  .card-media => aspect-[5/4] md:aspect-[4/3]
- Text policy:
  title line-clamp-2, subtitle line-clamp-1
- Profile placeholder:
  square (1/1), default size tokenized

Notes
- next/image is not used in gallery or hub cards.
- Gallery visuals are currently placeholder gradients/skeletons; no public/remote image pipeline in active gallery path.
